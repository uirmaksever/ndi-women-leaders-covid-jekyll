## General - Women and COVID-19

1.  Video created by UN Women of women and coronavirus [https://www.facebook.com/unwomen/videos/661369887953788/?v=661369887953788](https://www.facebook.com/unwomen/videos/661369887953788/?v=661369887953788)
    

-   Video shows the role of women in the fight against the virus, effects of the pandemic on women and girls, and the need for a gender sensitive crisis response.
    

Relevant topic for our sessions but I suggest using this not as a pre-read but maybe we could add to our sessions. I have found the Turkish version of this video. I also found a recent call from UN General Secretary Antonio Guterres to end the violence against women that increased with the Covid-19;

-   The article focuses on the effects of the social and economic impacts of the coronavirus on women on a global level.  
-   UN Women is working with partners on supporting gender analysis and sex-disaggregated data collection, as well as focusing on programmes that build women’s economic resilience for Covid-19. UN Women is working closely with WHO and other UN agencies and UN Country Teams to strengthen coordinated response to the outbreak. It’s also leveraging existing networks of women-led organizations to advance women’s voice and decision-making in COVID-19 preparedness and response.  
-   Set of recommendations that UN Women issued, placing women’s needs and leadership at the heart of effective response to COVID-19.
    
5: The article is in line with our program and would be beneficial in raising awareness on the impact of the virus, it draws a general picture of the effects of the virus on women in the workforce including the health care workers, includes a set of recommendations. It also shows UN Women’s works on the subject in different countries.

8.  Women are hit hardest by impact of coronavirus.
[https://thehill-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/490370-women-are-hit-hardest-by-impact-of-coronavirus?amp](https://thehill-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/490370-women-are-hit-hardest-by-impact-of-coronavirus?amp)
    -   This article focuses on the negative impacts of the virus on women in the US on an economic level, addressing the disproportionate toll this pandemic has on women.
    -   Crucial policies the NY state has, such as $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, guaranteed paid sick leave, equal pay, childcare funding, and tough laws on domestic violence and makes recommendations to other states and the federal government.
    -   Importance of women themselves speaking up and speaking out to their representatives from Town Halls to the halls of Congress, as well as increasing their engagement in political activism outside election cycles.
9.  Coronavirus is killing more men. But the lockdown is disastrous for women and their rights

10.  Women and the hidden burden of the coronavirus Experts say women are still “invisible” when it comes to global health. In the U.S., just 10 percent of the representatives of the Coronavirus Task Force are women. Women take on most of the world’s health care and are distinctly affected in global crises. [https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/488509-the-hidden-burden-of-the-coronavirus-on-women](https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/488509-the-hidden-burden-of-the-coronavirus-on-women)
	 -   First part of the article focuses on online parenting. In the second part, it raises attention to lack of representation of women in decision making about health and the virus, and looks through several issues the virus is causing.
	 -   While women provide the most health care around the world and are acutely affected by the pandemic, they are also largely left out of global health conversations. Women are underrepresented in decision-making spheres, and the world’s coronavirus response agencies are no exception. The World Health Organization's (WHO) Emergency Committee on COVID-19 is only 20 percent women. Accordingly, the WHO-China joint mission on COVID-19 is only 16 percent women.
	    -   Economic impacts: Women also disproportionately hold jobs without protections like paid leave and in fields jeopardized by social-distancing and widespread shutdowns.
	    -   Increasing domestic violence.

32.  The Catch-22 at the Heart of The crisis. So does it matter if there are still more men leading the fight? Yes, we are, and yes, it does. Why? Because, this is not only a health emergency, it is also a profound shock to our societies and economies. Which is why the COVID-19 crisis also has long-term opportunities and threats for gender equality and women’s political empowerment following in its wake.

	-   5: Mor Çatı Foundation prepared this follow-up report on how mechanisms work in combating violence against women, based on the knowledge and experience they gained from women who have been subjected to violence since March 16. As shared in the report, the main problem is that the mechanisms women need to stay away from violence are not working. The Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Services do not have an emergency action plan to provide solutions to the problems arising from the epidemic, and that the existing mechanisms are not operated under the pretext of the epidemic.    
	-   The report also includes suggestions for what should be done primarily during the coronavirus outbreak.

## Economics

60.  Gender economist Katica Roy: If we don't act fast, women will bear the brunt of the financial crisis caused by coronavirus

		-   The article analyzes the economic impact the crisis will have on women.
    
		-   Instead of ignoring gender, elected officials should practice gender mainstreaming when crafting policies to ensure that all members of society benefit equitably from them.
    
		-   Elected officials should apply the gender lens to all fiscal stimulus going forward and recognize that men and women need different tools to weather the storm.
    
		-   As job layoffs continue, women’s economic power will continue to deteriorate.
    
		-   3: There are some suggestions that would help sustain consumer spending, and to strengthen the economic power, yet it is not gender specific, and are mostly recommendations for the national government.

## Pregnancy

71.  Here’s what we know about being pregnant in a pandemic
[https://link.cgdev.org/e/683263/what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-/5gpnv/215768035?h=QTlclj5tFXwmsgRA65aQD_8BpqoWYJUEzg1kcJ8OUiE](https://link.cgdev.org/e/683263/what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-/5gpnv/215768035?h=QTlclj5tFXwmsgRA65aQD_8BpqoWYJUEzg1kcJ8OUiE)
    
		-   So far, pregnant women do not seem any more likely than the general public to contract Covid-19, nor does it seem they are more likely to develop severe symptoms.
    
		-   With respiratory viral infections that can cause severe pneumonia — covid-19 falls into this category — both the mother and the fetus risk not getting enough oxygen, with potentially dire consequences.
    
		-   So far, there seem to be a significant number of preterm deliveries in pregnant women with the virus, which can lead to health problems for the baby.
    
		-   Dealing with a small number of patients makes it difficult to determine what’s coincidence and what is actually a direct or indirect result of mom being infected with the virus.
    
		-   4: I would call this as important, especially the “What we do know” part and beyond. There is not much in-depth data regarding the effects of Covid-19 on pregnant women. It was also raised in our last meeting with SES to be a part of the sessions, especially the pregnant health care workers.

After the corona pandemic, everyone is concerned about the course of the world. Nobody knows what the future holds for the world and humanity. But those who are most concerned are probably those who were caught in the epidemic by raising a life in their bodies, that is, pregnant women.
    

## Age

74.  Why women over sixty cope with crisis and emerge stronger.

-   Article is about a 77 years old women CEO, explaining why midlife women are the best prepared for an emergency emotionally, arguing in mature years, it’s time for women to be fearless, speak out and support other women. Midlife women, she argues, can become the most powerful community on earth.
    
-   2: I don’t think the article is relevant for the sessions, both in terms of language and context. The article follows an interview format, and the context is not suitable for a pre-read. Though we could add it to the sessions as a topic, if needed.
